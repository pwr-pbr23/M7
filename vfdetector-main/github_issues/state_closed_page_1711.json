See the answer to [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16612293/scipy-misc-imread-creates-an-image-with-no-size-or-shape) for a suggestion on how to fix it.\n\nMy guess is that a different version of some common library like `numpy` is being loaded when you load the modules in the two different orders, which leads to the confusion. This would seem especially likely if you had installed TensorFlow in a virtualenv, since TensorFlow installs its own copies of some libraries (including `numpy`), which might not be compatible with the system-installed version of, e.g., `scipy`.\n", "Thank you @mrry !
