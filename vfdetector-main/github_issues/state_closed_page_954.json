As in `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn()`, the `time_major` controls input format to [max_time, batch_size, num_inputs] if it is `True` or [batch_size, max_time, num_inputs] if `False`. The `time_major` will only used when `sequence_lengths` is provided (meaning the new cuDNN RNN API is used).

V3 kernel is  called if seq_len is not None, or time_major is False.\r\n_I think time_major has to depend on sequence_length for now.

It seems that it autonomously adds an \"_n\" to some variable names which destroy the whole weight sharing process in many networks. I have a sample piece of code here to explain what I mean:\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\ninput = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 100], name = 'input')\r\n\r\nfor t in range(0, 10):\r\n    for i in range(0, 2):\r\n        with tf.variable_scope('InnerLoop_' + str(i) + '/', reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE): #tried with and without  '/'\r\n            h = tf.layers.dense(input, 100, name='myDense')\r\n            print(h)\r\n```\r\nIn fact, I need to define 2 dense layers in the inner loop (the '+str(i)' in the variable_scope name supports taht) and these layers must be shared and have the SAME NAME in all of 10 time steps (outter loop).\r\nThe output of the print is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_1/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_1/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_2/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_2/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_3/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_3/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_4/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_4/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_5/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_5/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_6/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_6/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_7/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_7/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_8/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_8/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_0/myDense_9/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\nTensor(\"InnerLoop_1/myDense_9/BiasAdd:0\", shape=(?, 100), dtype=float32)\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the dense layer name (myDense) follows by a \"_t\", in which t is the outer loop indicator.\r\nWhy does it autonomously add something to the name of a layer? I tried to put the outer loop also in a for loop but it doesn't solve the problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, the documentation states: \r\n\r\n> name: String, the name of the layer.\r\n\r\n> reuse: Boolean, whether to reuse the weights of a previous layer by the same name.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing mentioned in the document that Tensorflow changes the naming, and how is it possible to do weight sharing when it changes the naming and builds actual new weight matrices?\r\n \r\n\r\nI was hoping if you guys can point me to part of the documentation which explains what is happening. Or tell me if there is any logic behind what is happening.", "comments": ["Hi,\r\n```tf.layers.dense``` has a reuse parameter which will solve your issue.
