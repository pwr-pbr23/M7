We have a module system that can give us access to plenty of modern tooling, but I only have access to glibc 2.12.  Installing binary bazel releases fail since they depend on glibc 2.14 and I have also been unable to build bazel 0.1.0/0.1.1/HEAD from scratch due to compilation errors.  For now I have given up on making TensorFlow work on the cluster [pending the issue I filed with bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/583).\n", "welp... time for 14.04 I guess\n", "Upgrading ubuntu is definitely the best way to go. But if not...\n\nI would not upgrade the system libc.so on the shared cluster. It should be backward compatible but there are regression here and there. You can still make it work if you want to. If you grep libc from newer package [http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libc6](click on amd64). You can extract that deb. Then you can use LD_PRELOAD the files from content directory. See something like [https://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/] or [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223971/question-about-overriding-c-standard-library-functions-and-how-to-link-everythin].\n\nLibc has pretty much no dependencies but kernel. I believe tensorflow does not need anything fancy new there. Newer libc in custom directory and LD_PRELOAD trick should allow you to run the bazel binaries from download as well as the tensorflow pip (you may not need to recompile anymore). Good for shared cluster with old system.\n\nBTW: Google / bazel philosophy is to rebuild everything from sources (that's why bazel download so many git repos). That also means there are very little external dependencies. But yes, it depends on libc.\n", "I don't have sudo permission, so updating or installing GLIBC is not possible. I tried extracting libc6 from debian package and set the path in LD_PRELOAD but it's not using that instead it always point to **/lib64/libc.so.6**(ImportError: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found) but my LD_PRELOAD is defined as **/home/hpc/pr63so/ga93yih2/lib/libc.so.6**\n\nThe reason is because LD_PRELOAD is not loading properly, am getting following error message\n\nERROR: ld.so: object '/home/hpc/pr63so/ga93yih2/lib/libc.so.6' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.\n\nany workaround for this?\n", "Does anyone solve this?\nI use cent os 6.x and it's glibc version is under the 2.12.\n\n```\n(tensorflow)[dev-srv /home/user/tensorflow]# yum info glibc\nLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, security\nDetermining fastest mirrors\nInstalled Packages\nName        : glibc\nArch        : i686\nVersion     : 2.12\n```\n\nI download glibc-2.17-78.el7.x86_64.rpm in the Internet and uncompress rpm to /opt/tensorflow/glibc diretory.\n\n```\n(tensorflow)[dev-srv /home/user/tensorflow]# ls /opt/tensorflow/glibc/lib64/\nld-2.17.so               libanl-2.17.so   libcidn.so.1      libm-2.17.so           libnss_compat.so.2  libnss_files-2.17.so   libnss_nis.so.2         libresolv-2.17.so    libthread_db.so.1\nld-linux-x86-64.so.2     libanl.so.1      libcrypt-2.17.so  libm.so.6              libnss_db-2.17.so   libnss_files.so.2      libnss_nisplus-2.17.so  libresolv.so.2       libutil-2.17.so\nlibBrokenLocale-2.17.so  libc-2.17.so     libcrypt.so.1     libnsl-2.17.so         libnss_db.so.2      libnss_hesiod-2.17.so  libnss_nisplus.so.2     librt-2.17.so        libutil.so.1\nlibBrokenLocale.so.1     libc.so.6        libdl-2.17.so     libnsl.so.1            libnss_dns-2.17.so  libnss_hesiod.so.2     libpthread-2.17.so      librt.so.1           rtkaio\nlibSegFault.so           libcidn-2.17.so  libdl.so.2        libnss_compat-2.17.so  libnss_dns.so.2     libnss_nis-2.17.so     libpthread.so.0         libthread_db-1.0.so\n```\n\nFinally, I ran convolutional.py with LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH option and those neither helpful.

All you've got to do then is call the notebook via another port on your host. So it's not on `localhost:8888` anymore but - as given in the example - on `localhost:8080`. For instance you could use the pretty arbitrarily chosen port 5776 which should be free on most systems... so your start command for docker should be like `docker run -it -p 5776:8888 b.gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow`. \n\nHope it's correct and that it helps...\n", "@HWiese1980 Thanx for quick reply .

I can't test it myself here because I'm on a metered connection for the time being and don't have the docker container on my PC anymore due to a complete Windows reinstall... \n\nSo you have a notebook directly running on your host, right? If you do, it is the reason why port 8888 is already in use on your host. That's that notebook server running outside of the docker container. That notebook cannot import tensorflow because it would require it to be installed directly (!) on your host. For running a tensorflow session you don't need a notebook server running outside of docker!

That means you could still use Python to build graph, but load models and run it within a Node.js runtime.

This would still require first creating a node C++ add-on, but rather than binding to the C API directly, you can employ \"embedded\" python to run python methods directly from C++.\r\n\r\nThis is unlike other JS => Python solutions out there that suggest simply spawning a python script...a solution not viable for any reasonable size learning problems because of the extensive data transfer cost (time) between the processes. With embedded python however, memory accessed by your python script / numpy arrays directly point to your js Float32Array buffers.\r\n\r\nThis solution is working very well for me (though admittedly getting the initial js => C++ => python flow working was kind of a pain). Since I have specific needs, I have not gone through the task of binding to each individual python TensorFlow method, and instead just pass my data and hyper parameters to a few methods that build most of the graph. The full individual binding wouldnt be too bad from my current starting point.\r\n\r\nI welcome any thoughts or suggestions on the approach outlined above.

Once the C/C++ API is compiled to wasm, you just need to ensure the necessary API is exposed. wasm will run in Node.js, all major browsers, and even outside of any of those, since it is meant to be an extremely portable bytecode.

One quick way you could do this in Bazel is by defining a macro in `tensorflow/contrib/node/defs.bzl`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef node_binary(name, srcs, data=None, visibility=None, testonly=None, **kwargs):\r\n  native.sh_binary(\r\n      name = name,\r\n      srcs = [name + \".sh\"],\r\n      data = srcs + data + [\"@org_nodejs\"],\r\n      testonly = testonly,\r\n      visibility = visibility,\r\n      **kwargs\r\n  )\r\n  \r\n  native.genrule(\r\n      name = name + \"_sh\",\r\n      srcs = [srcs[0]],\r\n      outs = [name + \".sh\"],\r\n      cmd = \"cat >$@ <<'EOF'\\n\" +\r\n            \"#!/bin/bash\\n\" +\r\n            \"NODE=external/org_nodejs/bin/node\\n\" +\r\n            \"if [[ -e external/org_nodejs/node.exe ]]; then\\n\" +\r\n            \"  NODE=external/org_nodejs/node.exe\\n\" +\r\n            \"fi\\n\" +\r\n            \"exec $${NODE} $(location \" + srcs[0] + \") \\\"$$@\\\"\\n\" +\r\n            \"EOF\",\r\n      executable = True,\r\n      testonly = testonly,\r\n      visibility = [\"//visibility:private\"],\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow for the fun part. I would write a single .js file (even if it had to be 30,000 lines long like [tex.web](http://tug.org/texlive/devsrc/Build/source/texk/web2c/tex.web)) with zero dependencies other than the Node standard library. The inputs for this program would be [ops.pbtxt](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/ops.pbtxt) and all the other pbtxt files in [api_def/base_api](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/api_def/base_api). The output to this program would be exactly one gigantic C++ file that talks to [TensorFlow C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/c/c_api.h) and [Node C++ Addon API](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) based on [this example](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples/tree/master/1_hello_world/node_0.12).\r\n\r\n```py\r\nload(\"//tensorflow/contrib/node:defs.bzl\", \"node_binary\")\r\nload(\"@domain_registry//java/google/registry/builddefs:zip_file.bzl\", \"zip_file\")\r\n\r\nnode_binary(\r\n    name = \"generate\",\r\n    srcs = [\"generate.js\"],\r\n    data = [\r\n        \"//tensorflow/core:ops/ops.pbtxt\",\r\n        \"//tensorflow/core/api_def:base_api_def\",\r\n    ],\r\n)\r\n\r\ngenrule(\r\n    name = \"api\",\r\n    srcs = [\r\n        \"//tensorflow/core:ops/ops.pbtxt\",\r\n        \"//tensorflow/core/api_def:base_api_def\",\r\n    ],\r\n    cmd = \"$(location :generate) $(location api.cc) $(SRCS)\",\r\n    outs = [\"api.cc\"],\r\n    tools = [\":generate\"],\r\n)\r\n\r\nzip_file(\r\n    name = \"tfnode\",\r\n    srcs = [\r\n        \"package.json\",\r\n        \"README.md\",\r\n        \"api.cc\",\r\n        \"binding.gyp\",\r\n        \"tfnode.js\",\r\n    ],\r\n    mappings = {\"tensorflow/contrib/node\": \"package\"},\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you `bazel build //tensorflow/contrib/node:tfnode.zip` and bam you've got your NodeJS project all bundled and ready for distribution to places like NPM.\r\n\r\nIf I wrote this (which I won't) it would be a barebones direct mapping of the TensorFlow API definitions.

Don't require a complete C++ or JS reproduction or abstraction of the API\r\n\r\nInstead, it should provide a complete 1-to-1 interface with the C API, [providing convenient JS abstractions](https://github.com/rchipka/node-tensorflow/tree/master/lib) as much as possible.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Don't maintain the C API [bindings](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node/blob/master/binding/tfjs_binding.cc) [by](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node/blob/master/binding/tfe_utils.cc) [hand](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node/blob/master/binding/tfjs_backend.cc)\r\n\r\nInstead, it should [use a swig script](https://github.com/rchipka/node-tensorflow/blob/master/src/tensorflow.i) to map the core data structures between Tensorflow/stdc++/V8/node and the rest will follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI got pretty far along with this, but last I remember a was having issues with TF_Session related segfaults.\r\n\r\nRight now it's just collecting dust, so if someone wants to jump in and help with this I'd gladly accept PRs.", "Closing as this is resolved"]}, {"number": 36, "title": "No module named tensorflow.python.platform", "body": "when running \npython tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py \n\nget the following error: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py\", line 14, in <module>\n    import tensorflow.python.platform\nImportError: No module named tensorflow.python.platform\n", "comments": ["For this to work, you'll have to install the PIP package.
