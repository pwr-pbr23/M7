The only problem is that I would like to apply it AFTER the rest of the computation graph is defined. As far as I understand, the current dropout function has to be applied before. This is what I am referring to when I say graph replacement. In theano, the mechanism to do this is use the theano.clone function with a replace dictionary as argument. The reason that I would like to do it like that, is that I want to use this kind of function in all the weights. So, for example, the weights that correspond to a LSTM that I don't have access to. Ideally, I would like to do something like this:\n\nvars = tf.variables.all_variables()\nnew_vars = [tf.nn.dropout(var) for var in vars ]\ntf.replace(vars, new_vars)\n\nFor a less general example: How can I apply dropout to the weights of a lstm?\n\nI saw this discussion that is related, but I would like to know if there is a simpler way of doing things:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/33748552/tensorflow-how-to-replace-a-node-in-a-calculation-graph\n\nThanks!\n", "OK great, I've renamed the title to reflect the more general feature request.\n\nI can think of various ways to do this, but none of them are the same as theano.clone. They involve duplicating the entire graph as mentioned in the SO post, or decomposing your graph into \"functions\" (a currently experimental and evolving feature) and using tf.cond to select which branch to run at runtime, etc, or using sess.partial_run or tf.py_func (also both evolving and experimental) to embed the logic in the user program rather than in the graph.\n\nThanks for the feature request!\n", "+1 :)\n", "Closing since the merged PR #557 seems related."]}, {"number": 1069, "title": "Use external repository rather than git submodule for protobuf dependency", "body": "Currently, TensorFlow vendors its protobuf dependency using a Git submodule due to the [hack](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/BUILD#L487) that is required for protobuf Python support.\n\nI have made a change (bazelbuild/bazel#702) to add an [`imports` attribute](http://bazel.io/docs/be/python.html#py_library.imports) to Bazel's Python rules, which allows us to add directories to the `PYTHONPATH` and thus allows us to remove the hack in protobuf.\n\nI have a patch to remove the hack for protobuf Python support (see google/protobuf#1230).
